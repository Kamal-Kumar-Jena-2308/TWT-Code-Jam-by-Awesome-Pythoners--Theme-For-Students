# Timathon - Student's Helper (Theme- For Students)

This is my program 
made by the team "Awesome Pythoners" - A solo team. The theme is "For Students". Hope you like the Program. It's a tkinter program used as a dicitionary, wiki and the most important Break Corner. You can also point out a mistake and open a PR. 
# Dictionary
The dictionary is a just an API. I used request module (obviously). This gives you the meaning and an an example sentence.
# Wikipedia
The Wikipedia is a module which is part of Python (Of Course). It's very easy to get any person's wiki from there.
# The Snake Game (Break Corner)
It is an pygame program with pictures, sounds effects etc. The Game took a week to complete. Some simple rules all of us know
